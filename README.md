## Spacebeam
Spacebeam is an open-source Linux cluster distribution that enables end users easily build computational clusters, grid endpoints and visualization tiled-displays.

We are driven by this goal to help deliver the computational power of clusters to a wide range of users, making stable and manageable distributed computing platforms available to a wide range of people.
